I am Titus Irma Damaiyanti, currently work mostly with Spring MVC framework, Spring Boot, API and Web Engineering, from development to maintenance at eWIDEPLUS corp., South Korea. 

Realizing that the mobile development getting my attention nowadays, I started learning Flutter, by building the layout from scratch and connecting to the API I made by applying micro service concept. Running, watching movies, reading, and cycling currently become the things I love to do outside the tech related activities, because the universe currently prevent us to travel.
