Prototyping Hancook Project (Ideas, Concept & Everything by Ninankara) using spring boot frammework.

Hancook: Let your Master Chef dream comes true
This project is developed for joining local competition held by Food Safety Korea Institution. Amazingly, my team and I (team of 3 members), passed the first round and had a chance to present it in final. Eventhough we didn’t get the awards, but we are still grateful for this experience.

Background Problem
The popularity of K-FOOD is increasing after Hallyu Wave is spreading globally. However, the korean food restaurant is not available everywhere. For those who wants to try but cannot find a proper korean restaurant, they usually cooking by themselves, by looking recipes from books, blogs, or videos. However, would they revive the original taste of K-FOOD? I don’t think so. Since Food Safety Institution provides recipe data, we decided to use it as a K-FOOD standard.
